All times are measured in seconds. These were all run on a dual 1ghz G4
running OS X 10.3.1 with Apple's latest VM (JDK 1.4.1_01-27). Each test
was run 8 times within a single VM. The highest and lowest times were
removed and the remaining 6 were averaged. In each case only the first
run differed significantly from the rest.

The libjpeg test consisted of decoding a 1280x1024 jpeg
(thebride_1280.jpg) and writing a tga. The mspack test consisted of
extracting all members from arial32.exe, comic32.exe, times32.exe, and
verdan32.exe. The freetype test consisted of rendering characters
32-127 of Comic.TTF at sizes from 8 to 48 incrementing by 4. (That is
about 950 individual glyphs).

I can provide you with the source for any of these test if you'd like.
